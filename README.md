# ALL_BROWSER_FINDER
No need of downloading apps like Google, Edge, and Safari...you can access all popular search engines with this code!



Here are the steps for using the ALL_BROWSERS_FINDER

1. Open this link "https://github.com/nathfavour/ALL_BROWSER_FINDER" in your browser.
   OR install git in your system and run "git clone https://github.com/nathfavour/ALL_BROWSER_FINDER"
2. 
3. THEN, NAVIGATE TO THE ALL_BROWSERS_FINDER FOLDER
4. 
5. NB: I might have named my project differently, but it doesn’t matter
6. 
7. Next, run this command.  “ python install -r requirements.txt” (or "python3 install -r requirements.txt" for MacOs)
8. 
9. Next, run “python finder.py”
10. 
11. When the program loads on the command line, then next you can choose which of the search engines that you want to conduct the search from
12. 
13. Insert your search term, or google dork
14. 
15. Next, choose whether you want to open the page or save it as .html
    Normally, It will load the page, or you can just save it as html file.
16. 
17. For tor, search results are saved to "tor_results.html", for every other search engine, results are saved to "search_results.html" in INPUT folder
18. 
19. I recommend you open the page in a browser-app, except you want to do some further extraction from the search results, then you should save it as .html file
20. 
21. If you have any error, it either has to do with the imported libraries, or the network connection;
22. 
23. In case you want to get results from ChatGPT, you first have to generate an openai-key, and save it in the key.py file, in between the double quotes of the 'chatgpt_key' string variable.
24. 
25. Finally, If you're going to use tor browser, you'd better know a bit of programming!...naturally it will give errors so you have to ocnfigure tor system settings to allow connections from a port...read the error messages, and use ChatGPT heavily!

THANKS!

I will soon be releasing this as an extension for all browsers!!!
